Unlike traditional server-side technologies that use multi-threading to handle multiple requests, Node.js employs a non-blocking, single-threaded, event-driven architecture. This enables Node.js to manage a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations by allowing chaining and handling errors more elegantly. The async/await syntax, introduced in ES6, simplifies asynchronous code by making it look more synchronous while still maintaining the non-blocking nature of Node.js.",

It allows developers to write non-blocking, highly scalable applications using the event loop to handle concurrent operations. When an asynchronous operation completes, it triggers an event, and any registered event listeners (callbacks) associated with that event are executed. This design promotes efficiency by preventing the system from waiting for one operation to complete before moving on to the next. It also enables real-time applications and enhances scalability, making Node.js suitable for handling many concurrent connections efficiently.",

        answer:
          "Shopify Online Store 1.0 limited sections to the home page, while 2.0 introduced sections on every page. This significant shift also requires developers to render templates using JSON files in version 2.0 instead of Liquid files. In addition, Shopify improved meta fields and introduced theme app extensions and new developer tools. These changes reflect Shopify's commitment to enhancing the customization capabilities of its themes, providing more flexibility and control for developers.",

      {
        heading:
          "Explain the differences between layouts, templates, sections, and snippet files in Shopify themes.",
        answer: `In Shopify themes, layouts serve as the foundational structure that contains elements shared across all store pages. Templates, however, are specific files unique to different types of pages (e.g., home, product, cart). Sections represent reusable blocks of content that can be added to templates, enhancing the modularity and flexibility of themes. Lastly, snippets are smaller, reusable code components that can be included within templates and sections to maintain code consistency. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for efficient theme customization and development, allowing developers to create highly adaptable and maintainable Shopify themes.`,

        heading:
          "Explain WordPress taxonomy and its practical uses for content organization.",
        answer: `WordPress taxonomy classifies content, enhancing site navigation and user experience. Categories group content under broad topics, whereas Tags offer specific keyword-based grouping. For example, a blog might utilize "Technology" as a Category and "AI" as a Tag. Taxonomies ensure coherent content organization, simplifying content discovery for users.`,

        heading:
          "How would you assess and improve the page speed of a Shopify theme?",
        answer:
          "Assessing and enhancing the page speed of a Shopify theme is essential for providing a seamless shopping experience. Shopify offers a speed score based on Google Lighthouse performance metrics, found in the themes section of the Shopify admin. To improve performance, developers can analyze this report for insights and focus on optimizing critical aspects such as image sizes, code minification, and reducing unnecessary HTTP requests. Implementing lazy loading for images and leveraging content delivery networks (CDNs) can enhance page speed. Prioritizing these optimizations ensures customers experience fast-loading pages, increasing satisfaction and conversions.",

        answer: `Shopify themes from the official store inherently support multiple languages and currencies. In Shopify admin, these features can be configured in the "Settings" menu, allowing merchants to provide localized shopping experiences for customers worldwide. Developers can also employ the Shopify Translate & Adapt app or choose from various third-party translation apps to implement translations efficiently. Ensuring compatibility with multiple languages and currencies is crucial for expanding the reach of an online store and catering to a diverse customer base. Shopify's built-in capabilities and the availability of translation apps simplify this process, making it accessible to developers and merchants alike.`,
