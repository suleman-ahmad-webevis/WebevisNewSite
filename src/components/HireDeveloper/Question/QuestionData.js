Unlike traditional server-side technologies that use multi-threading to handle multiple requests, Node.js employs a non-blocking, single-threaded, event-driven architecture. This enables Node.js to manage a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations by allowing chaining and handling errors more elegantly. The async/await syntax, introduced in ES6, simplifies asynchronous code by making it look more synchronous while still maintaining the non-blocking nature of Node.js.",

It allows developers to write non-blocking, highly scalable applications using the event loop to handle concurrent operations. When an asynchronous operation completes, it triggers an event, and any registered event listeners (callbacks) associated with that event are executed. This design promotes efficiency by preventing the system from waiting for one operation to complete before moving on to the next. It also enables real-time applications and enhances scalability, making Node.js suitable for handling many concurrent connections efficiently.",
