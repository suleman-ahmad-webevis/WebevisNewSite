        heading: "What is Reconciliation in React?",
        answer:
          "Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the actual DOM when a component's props or state changes. It involves comparing the newly returned element with the previously rendered one. When they are not equal, React updates the DOM. This efficient process ensures that only necessary changes are made, enhancing performance and user experience.",

        heading: "Explain JSX and its purpose in React.",
        answer:
          "JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React. It allows developers to write UI components more intuitively and declaratively. JSX is compiled into React.createElement() function calls, which create React elements. It helps describe the structure of the UI and enhances readability, making it easier to understand and work with complex UI structures.",

          "How would you optimize a React codebase for better performance? ",
        answer:
          "Various strategies can be employed to improve React code efficiency. These include using memoization, React.memo, PureComponent, and optimizing renders to minimize unnecessary updates. Dividing components into smaller, reusable parts can also help reduce the amount of markup that needs to be rerendered, enhancing performance.",

        heading: " What is the role of the state in React?",
        answer:
          " In React, state is a way to store data that belongs to a component and can change over time. When the state changes, the component rerenders. Unlike props, which are passed from parent to child components, the state is private and controlled solely by the component. It's useful for storing dynamic data that influences how a component appears and behaves.",

        heading: " How do CSS Modules address styling issues in React?",
        answer:
          " CSS Modules offer a solution for managing CSS in React projects by locally scoping styles to individual components. This prevents global style conflicts and enhances encapsulation. With CSS Modules, styles are scoped to the specific component they are applied to, minimizing unintended side effects and making styling more predictable.",
