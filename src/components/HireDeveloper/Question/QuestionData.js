Unlike traditional server-side technologies that use multi-threading to handle multiple requests, Node.js employs a non-blocking, single-threaded, event-driven architecture. This enables Node.js to manage a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations by allowing chaining and handling errors more elegantly.

        answer:
          "Scaling a Node.js application can involve vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single server) or horizontal scaling (distributing load across multiple servers). Tools like PM2 can help manage various Node.js processes. Load balancers like Nginx can distribute incoming traffic, while caching mechanisms reduce server load. Additionally, a microservices architecture and a distributed database can improve scalability.",

        answer:
          "Node.js's event-driven architecture is based on the concept of events and event listeners. It allows developers to write non-blocking, highly scalable applications using the event loop to handle concurrent operations. When an asynchronous operation completes, it triggers an event, and any registered event listeners (callbacks) associated with that event are executed. This design promotes efficiency by preventing the system from waiting for one operation to complete before moving on to the next. It also enables real-time applications and enhances scalability, making Node.js suitable for handling many concurrent connections efficiently.",
